# Armenian Eastern Keyboard Layout for macOS (Unicode, native, no additional software is required)
I have created a macOS version of the keyboard layout which was originally available in Windows and was called "Armenian Eastern".

## How to install
The steps below have been tested on macOS Sequoia..
- Clone or download this repository.
- After cloning or downloading the repository, go to the "*Armenian-Eastern-Keyboard-Layout-for-macOS*" directory.
- Double-click the "*Armenian (Eastern).dmg*" file to mount the disk image.
- A new window will open with the contents of the disk image. Double-click the "*Armenian (Eastern).bundle*" file.
- The keyboard installer will open. Click on the "*Install for the current user (recommended)*" side.
- Go to *System Settings > Keyboard > Text Input*, click *Edit…*
- In the window that opens, click the *+* sign, select *Armenian* on the left, click *Armenian - Eastern*, then click the *Add* button. Finally, click *Done*.
- Now you can see the Armenian language with the Armenian - Eastern keyboard layout in the upper right corner of your Mac screen.
- You can use the *fn* button or the *control ⌃ + option ⌥ + command ⌘* keyboard shortcut to switch between input languages.
